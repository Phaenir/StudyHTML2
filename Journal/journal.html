    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>
      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla,
      WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO,
      Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
      "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
          you, A glimpse, Of eternity."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing
      any cars.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <em>"A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway."</em>
